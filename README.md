Variable Visibility Glasses (NASA TOPS: LAR-TOPS-1 | US Patent: #8,411,214)
- Skills: Software Development 路 Python 路 Linux 路 Raspberry Pi 路 Operating Systems

- NASA developed and tested special glasses that uses novel sensors to determine head position, the glasses restrict the view out of the aircraft windscreen but allow the pilot to clearly see the entire instrument panel, providing a much more realistic low visibility instrument flying experience.
- Developed software that connects the sensors to the glasses which hide/show depending on the orientation of the user's head and created a user interface mimicking a cockpit of an aircraft for demonstration purposes.
